  File Description:
  After putting in entry, move focus outside of input box calls function to
  validate the entry passing the index of that input box in the node collection.
  message under input box displays if entry was valid or invalid with message.
  
  I have a table element in my html which I used for testing
  adding rows in the html initially and then changed all adding of rows
  to javascript functions.  (There was no horizontal line displayed
  in this configuration.)
  When I changed display of table to "block" to allow scrolling, a horizontal line appeared
  on my page before any table is generated.  (I played a bit with
  borders of the table and cells but ran out of time.)
  I tried to make a sticky column for the horizontal scrolling but
  had issues.  Not sure if I needed to add a tbody and add the cells to it
  or change my cells from td to th cells.  I ran out of time to
  play more with this.
  I ran out of time to style the rows.

  Input testing: Invalid input box entries for each input box
  such as abc, -51, 51, 1.2 and others.  Message underneath box will update
  when focus changes from that input box.  Invalid values are highlighted in gold.
  When the max input box for columns or rows is entered, the min/max range
  is also checked and invalid min value is highlighted in gold.
  I originally had the input cleared out if it was invalid but after
  seeing Jose's video, a previous grader, on the assignment, I changed my code to leave in the value.
